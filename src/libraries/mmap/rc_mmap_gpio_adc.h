/*
This is a collection of functions for operating GPIO and ADC
on the TI AM335x Sitara Processors. These operate with direct memory access
instead of userspace drivers. Therefore this code must be run as root, but
they execute roughly 2 orders of magnitude faster than userspace drivers
depending on the exact function.

Note that a device tree overlay is still necessary to configure the
pin multiplexer and enable clock signal to each subsystem.

Big thanks to Ethan Hayon for the GPIO code
